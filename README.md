Blue Pipit population has been decreasing in Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve near Mistford, we need to figure out why by using the Hypothesis First Approach. By using Tableau to confirm our list of hypotheses, we narrowed them down to a couple, mostly focusing on visitor car itineraries. For example, we converted a bitmap of the reserve into a graph and used graph algorithms to detect speeding and trespassing. Then we implemented multiple coordinated visualizations with interactive features to visualize abnormal patterns of visitor cars in the preserve.
